# Statify
An application built with the intent of providing the full listening history of users in a digestible manner via superior data visualizations of time-series data. 

# Features as of 5/5/24

## Proper visualization of time-series data. 
Should work at any scope. Listening history of:
- Albums
- Artists
- Genres
- Playlists
  
## Taste profiles
Pie charts are cool to see the diversity of your taste. Same as above, can work for a multitude of scopes.

## Exploration coefficient
Proportion: (# of songs listened to for the first time) / (total songs listened to in given time period)
Should function properly at any time scope. Day, week, month, year, etc. As long as Spotify API can call back that far, should be good.

## Not monetized
Alternatives have stagnated or have been monitized-- locking user's data behind paywalls or littering the UI with ads. 
User data will never be locked behind a paywall. Most that will ever happen is adspace.
